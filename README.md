Browse and edit password stores.

Keycord works with password folders that use the standard [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) layout. Existing stores stay on disk as normal pass stores, so you can keep using compatible tools.

- Open one or more password stores and search by name, store, field, regular expression, or structured `find` query
- Edit entries with form fields or raw pass-file text, generate passwords, and copy passwords, usernames, or one-time login codes
- Add existing stores, create new stores, import passwords on supported systems, or restore a store from Git with the Host backend
- Manage store recipients, folder-specific `.gpg-id` files, private keys, FIDO2 security keys, and experimental OpenPGP smartcard workflows
- Sync Git-backed stores, manage remotes, sign changes, and inspect history with commit verification details
- Use the adaptive GTK interface with keyboard, pointer, or touch on desktop and mobile Linux
